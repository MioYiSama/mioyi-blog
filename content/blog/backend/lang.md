title: "Backend Development: Why I'm Betting on These Four Languages/Platforms"
tags: [backend]

## TypeScript

- Frontend is JS
- DX (Developer Experience)
- Async/Concurrency performance

## JVM (Java/Kotlin)

- Ecosystem, community, resources
- DX (Spring Boot)

The only drawback is memory consumption, but the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses.

## Go

- cloud native
- cloud infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Prometheus)

## Rust

- Pure performance

## Why other languages won't work

1. C#: Beaten by JVM in almost every aspect except performance. The stereotype of Microsoft and Windows is impossible to change.
2. Python: Beaten by JS in every aspect.
3. PHP/Ruby: Full-stack languages, not pure backend.
4. Zig: Backend development is about engineering; being too low-level (such as manual memory management) excessively reduces development efficiency.
